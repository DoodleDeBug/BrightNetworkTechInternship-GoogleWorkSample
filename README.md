# BrightNetwork UK google-code-sample 2021 aka YouTube in the Terminal

This repo is contains my solution to the Bright Network Internship Experience UK 2021 Google work sample. The language I chose to complete this in was Python. The challenge was to recreate YouTube in the terminal.

I found this to be a  really challenging and rewarding task that I began as part of the Tech Stream.
Since it was my first time working with Python, I was a little slow to get started and the learning curve was fairly steep, but after overcoming the initial hurdles, I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot :D

Within the 2 days working time we had (out of the 3 day experience) I managed to complete part 1 and 3, aswell as some of part 2 and 4. I then came back to it later and attempted the rest.
