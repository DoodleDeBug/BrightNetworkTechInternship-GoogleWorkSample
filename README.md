# google-code-sample

This was a really challenging and rewarding sample task I (semi-)completed as part of Bright Networks Internship Experience UK -Tech Stream.
Since it was my first tiem working with Python, I was a little slow to get started and the learning curve was fairly steep, but after overcoming the initial hurdles, I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot :D
